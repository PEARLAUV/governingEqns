Depending on the sea state, the platform could also be moving while doing operations 1-3.\n",

    "* $I_d$ = inherent degradation, an efficiency parameter that descrines the fraction of solar panel area that is actually solar cells, taken to be between 0.85-0.9. Value may also come from actual solar panel and use actual cell area from manufacturer. This term accounts for reduction in solar cell efficiency when you integrate it into an array. So could be due to the fact that the total panel area cannot be covered 100% in solar cells because of the interconnects and spacing between them. Can also use that term to account for if you expect any shadowing of cells by other components on the platformo for if the solar cells will be operating at a temperature different than what the efficiency is quoted at. According to SMAD for spacecraft it’s common to use $I_d$ = 0.72 (or ranging between 0.49 and 0.88). For this analysis, we neglect any shadowing issues for the servicing platform as well as efficiency degradations due to temperature (which are a bigger issue in space).\n",
